# covid19
I'm starting this repository to share faceshields and glasses prototypes i've created for medical professionals, and hope to help anyway. Please feel free to enter and improve my work somehow.

After reading a lot about digital fabrication projects on service to COVID-19 combat, i looked to some open source projects and started to work on them on the Fablab.

3D printing is a slow process, and most of the solutions i found were using that. I realized that lasercutting should be the technology to use.

I want to thank all the guys that are working on this projects and helping to secure or minimize contamination.

### Material used:
- 0,5mm petg sheets
